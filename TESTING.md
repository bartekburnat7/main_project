## Browser and Mobile compatibility

Each page has been designed with the mobile first approach, so therefore the website is responsive to smaller devices. With some differences depending on the content, pages should switch into mobile view if the size drops below 768 pixels.

I tested this by using the built in Chrome mobile viewer but have also used my Iphone 12 to further test my website.

The website was tested on multiple browsers to check for any compatibility bugs both in the mobile view and the desktop size view. The browsers on which I tested my website on:

-   Google Chrome
-   Internet Explorer
-   Safari
-   FireFox

Minor bugs were found where on the features page the videos would not auto-play due to safety reasons on the mobile phone.

## Unit Testing

I created 10 tests for all the urls and 2 tests for the views file which renders the html pages:

<details><summary>Jigsaw validator results</summary>
<img src="images/unit_test.jpg">
</details>

## Validator Testing

### CSS W3C Jigsaw Validator 
No errors found

<details><summary>Jigsaw validator results</summary>
<img src="images/test_css.jpg">
