## Browser and Mobile compatibility

Each page has been designed with the mobile first approach, so therefore the website is responsive to smaller devices. With some differences depending on the content, pages should switch into mobile view if the size drops below 768 pixels.accordion

I tested this by using the built in Chrome mobile viewer but have also used my Iphone 12 to further test my website.

The website was tested on multiple browsers to check for any compatibility bugs both in the mobile view and the desktop size view. The browsers on which I tested my website on:

-   Google Chrome
-   Internet Explorer
-   Safari
-   FireFox
