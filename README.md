# FitSync

fitsync is a Full-Stack online application created for personal trainers to keep track of their customers and schedule lessons so that the other users can know when the next lesson will take place. The website allows to create lessons that include the date and time with the username that this lesson was created for. This then can be edited or cancelled by the trainer and viewed by the following customer.

Users can schedule lessons with anyone
