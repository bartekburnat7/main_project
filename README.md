# FitSync

FitSync is a Full-Stack online application created for personal trainers to keep track of their students and schedule lessons with ease so that the students can check when their next lesson will take place. The website allows to create lessons for the user of choice that include the date, time and price. Each created lesson then can be edited or cancelled by the trainer and viewed by the following student.

I created this full-stack website using Django framework, Python, HTML/CSS Bootstrap and JavaScript. I used ElephantSQl as the database of choice to store the usernames and the Scheduled Lessons.
