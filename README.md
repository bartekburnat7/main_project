# FitSync

FitSync is a Full-Stack online application created for personal trainers to keep track of their students and schedule lessons with ease so that the students can check when their next lesson will take place. The website allows to create lessons for the user of choice that include the date, time and price. Each created lesson then can be edited or cancelled by the trainer and viewed by the following student.

I created this full-stack website using Django framework, Python, HTML/CSS Bootstrap and JavaScript. I used ElephantSQL as the database of choice to store the usernames and the Scheduled Lessons.

## User Interface / User Experience

While creating the website I decided to utilize Bootstrap 5 to create a responsive website for mobile and desktop users that has a very clean and professional layout. The website should have content the User can read before signing up to the service so they know if this application suits them. Users of all ages should be able to navigate through the website because each trainer might have different type of students this is very important.

####    Target client for the Website:

-   Based in the UK
-   Personal Trainer
-   Has Existing Clients
-   Individual

## Idea and Plan

The idea for this project came to when I was looking for a business idea to create within a online application that could be used commercially and all over the world without any constraints. As I am familiar with the gym I looked for a personal trainer in my area but it was very difficult to do so and ended up not finding anything at all due to no information on the matter.

My plan was to create an application with tools that Personal Trainers can use to schedule lessons, create workout plans and much more. I would first create great tools that would attract new trainers to sign up for a trainers account, then add a feature that would make finding these trainers easy by people that are seeking personal training in their area.

I asked a few personal trainers online what type of features they would like to see in the application and these are the results from most important to least:

-   Scheduling System
-   Online Workout Programming
-   Virtual Training(P2P)
-   Payments
-   Late Fees

### Agile

For this project I decided to use GitHub's issues tab and list all the challenges a trainer or user faces and give solutions under each one. Using the Agile methodology I planned out how I would tackle each issue and after developing the feature, I would assess if this feature is functional and addresses the issue correctly. If I was unhappy with the feature I would see that something is missing develop an additional solution to the feature.

##  Design

### Wireframes

I sketch my ideas of how the layout of the pages would look using moqups.com, so that I have a design that I can develop off of. Some changes might have been implemented due to finding a better way of displaying the information or due to adding an extra feature:

<details><summary>Home Page</summary>
<img src="images/home_page.JPG">
</details>
<details><summary>Dashboard for Trainers</summary>
<img src="images/dashboard_trainer_wireframe.JPG">
</details>
<details><summary>Dashboard for Students</summary>
<img src="images/dashboard_Student_wireframe.JPG">
</details>
<details><summary>Scheduling for Trainers</summary>
<img src="images/dashboard_scheduling_wireframe.JPG">
</details>
<br>

As I used the mobile first approach I also designed wireframe of what these pages would look like on a smaller device. I wanted to keep the design simple to not clatter the screen and make it difficult to follow or read:

<details><summary>Home Page</summary>
<img src="images/home_page_phone.JPG">
</details>
<details><summary>Dashboard for Trainers</summary>
<img src="images/dashboard_trainer_wireframe_phone.JPG">
</details>
<details><summary>Dashboard for Students</summary>
<img src="images/dashboard_Student_wireframe_phone.JPG">
</details>
<details><summary>Scheduling for Trainers</summary>
<img src="images/dashboard_scheduling_wireframe_phone.JPG">
</details>
<br>

Every feature that has been added, targets one or potentially more user stories in order to solve the problem of the user. While planning the layout I made sure each feature has a similar design that looks familiar, which improves the ease of navigating through out the website.

## Features

### Navigation
-   #### Navigation Bar
    There are a few type of navigation bars implemented for visiting users and logged in users, furthermore, there is a different navigation bar for the dashboard features that differs for students and trainers. For mobile users the nav bar becomes a hamburger that reveals the options when pressed.

    <details><summary>Navigation bar for home pages ( Logged Out )</summary>
    <img src="images/nav_bar_lo.JPG">#
    </details>
    <details><summary>Navigation bar for home pages ( Logged In )</summary>
    <img src="images/nav_bar_li.JPG">
    </details>
    <details><summary>Navigation bar for home pages ( Mobile )</summary>
    <img src="images/nav_bar_mobile.JPG">
    </details>
    <br>
    The dashboard visually look the same, the only difference between the two is the the list og pages inside the hamburger that appears from the right when pressed.
    
    <details><summary>Navigation bar for Dashboard ( Trainer Account ) - Dashboard, scheduling, homepage, log out</summary>
    <img src="images/nav_bar_dashboard.JPG">
    </details>
    <details><summary>Navigation bar for Dashboard ( Student Account ) - Dashboard, homepage, log out</summary>
    <img src="images/nav_bar_dashboard.JPG">
    </details>

### User Registration and Authentication

-   #### Sign up
    The website contains the Sign up page where the user is required to create a new username and a password, then the user need to make the choice if he wants to create a student account by default or select the checkbox and create a trainer account.

    <details><summary>Sign up page</summary>
    <img src="images/sign_up_page.JPG">
    </details>
    <br>

    The sign up form also performs checks in the backend if the username already exists, the passwords is too weak or similar to the username or if the password is not correctly re-typed.

    <details><summary>Sign up page form error messages</summary>
    <img src="images/sign_up_errors.JPG">
    </details>
    <br>

-   #### log In
    The log-in page visually shares a lot of similarities with the sign up page, this is done to make the pages more familiar to the user. The log-in page is kept clean and labeled to improve the accessibility and improves the SEO of the page.

    <details><summary>Log In page</summary>
    <img src="images/log_in_page.JPG">
    </details>
    <br>

    The log-in page also returns an error message if the entered username or password is incorrect:
    <details><summary>Log In page error messages</summary>
    <img src="images/log_in_errors.JPG">
    </details>
    <br>

    If an already logged in user tries to enter the log-in page they will be automatically redirected to the dashboard, the same happens for people that are logging in. When the user wants to log out they can do so by clicking the "log out" button which is placed in either the homepage nav bar or the dashboard navigation bar.

### Dashboard

The backend code check if the logged in user is a "student account" or a "trainer account" and redirects each user accordingly to the pages with the correct permissions assigned to the account type. Explained below:

-   __Student Dashboard__
    
    The student dashboard consist of two elements/features which are, the calendar where the student can see their upcoming lessons and the second feature is the container where the user can accept or cancel any incoming lessons created by the trainer under their username.

    <details><summary>Student Dashboard</summary>
    <img src="">
    </details>
    <br>

    This account type is forbidden from scheduling lessons for other usernames, if this account type tries to access the scheduling page they will be automatically redirected back to the designated dashboard.

-   __Trainer Dashboard__
    
    The trainer dashboard consists of three elements/features which are, the calendar where the trainer can see upcoming lessons which they created(from earliest to lates). The second feature is the earnings container which displays the amount of money that will be earned from all the lessons added up before and after fees. Lastly, there is a tab added with all the features accessible by the trainer account type and any features that will be available in the future.

    <details><summary>Trainer Dashboard</summary>
    <img src="images/trainer_dashboard.jpg">
    </details>
    <br>

### Scheduling

The scheduling dashboard is split into the submit form and a container that displays all the active lessons that have been created. The form requires the trainer to enter the students username, type of lesson, date of the lesson and finally the price. If the username entered into the form doesn't exist, it will return an error message saying "User does not exist".

<details><summary>Schedule Page</summary>
<img src="images/scheduling_page.JPG">
</details>
<details><summary>Schedule error messages</summary>
<img src="images/scheduling_page_error.JPG">
</details>
<br>

Each lesson displayed has a "more" button when pressed drops down two options which are "Edit" and "delete". 

#### Edit
-   When you press the "edit" option you will be redirected to a form where you can manipulate and edit the information to the lesson of choice. Once you edited the lesson accordingly, all you need to do is hit the "save" button and the lesson will be saved.

<details><summary>Edit Lesson Page</summary>
<img src="images/edit_lesson.JPG">
</details>

#### Delete
-   When you hit the "delete" option, the lesson of choice will be automatically deleted for the trainer and for the student.

## Database Design

The application consists of two main models taht are the "CustomUser" is where all the users are stored including passwords, email and type of account. Second model "Training Sessions" holds all the lessons which consist of what trainer created the user and for what student the lesson is for and the details accordingly. The "status" field contais the 3 options for each lesson.

<img src="images/database_diagram.JPG">

There is also a third model which is a "setting" table, which I added for further development where in the future I would like to add custom settings for each user.
