# FitSync

FitSync is a Full-Stack online application created for personal trainers to keep track of their students and schedule lessons with ease so that the students can check when their next lesson will take place. The website allows to create lessons for the user of choice that include the date, time and price. Each created lesson then can be edited or cancelled by the trainer and viewed by the following student.

I created this full-stack website using Django framework, Python, HTML/CSS Bootstrap and JavaScript. I used ElephantSQl as the database of choice to store the usernames and the Scheduled Lessons.

## User Interface / User Experience

While creating the website I decided to utilize Bootstrap 5 to create a responsive website for mobile and desktop users that has a very clean and professional layout. The website should have content the User can read before signing up to the service so they know if this application suits them. Users of all ages should be able to navigate through the website because each trainer might have different type of students this is very important.

####    Target client for the Website:

-   Based in the UK
-   Personal Trainer
-   Has Existing Clients
-   Individual

## Idea and Plan

The idea for this project came to when I was looking for a business idea to create within a online application that could be used commercially and all over the world without any constraints. As I am familiar with the gym I looked for a personal trainer in my area but it was very difficult to do so and ended up not finding anything at all due to no information on the matter.

My plan was to create an application with tools that Personal Trainers can use to schedule lessons, create workout plans and much more. I would first create great tools that would attract new trainers to sign up for a trainers account, then add a feature that would make finding these trainers easy by people that are seeking personal training in their area.

I asked a few personal trainers online what type of features they would like to see in the application and these are the results from most important to least:

-   Scheduling System
-   Online Workout Programming
-   Virtual Training(P2P)
-   Payments
-   Late Fees

### Agile

For this project I decided to use GitHub's issues tab and list all the challenges a trainer or user faces and give solutions under each one. Using the Agile methodology I planned out how I would tackle each issue and after developing the feature, I would assess if this feature is functional and addresses the issue correctly. If I was unhappy with the feature I would see that something is missing develop an additional solution to the feature.
